Protocol (as of 2/9):
Server will listen on port 4269 (TCP)

Other notes:

    You are permitted to work in groups of two (or alone if you want)
    Since everyone is (hopefully) working from the same protocol, any client should be able to work with any server. You may get together with other groups to test compatibility
    To help, I will require three users to be created by everone (you may create additional users if you want)
        user1, with password 'abcdef'
        user2, with password '123456'
        user3, with password 'chatroom'
    And three chat rooms named 'csc460', 'csit' and 'general' (create at least two additional chat rooms)
    You should submit a ZIP file of either (a) Nebeans Project, (b) Java file, (c) Python file, or (d) Visual Studio 2019 project.
    Due date is Feb 28
